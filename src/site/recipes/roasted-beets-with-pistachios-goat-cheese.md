ingredients: |-
  * 3 large beets or 6 medium
  * olive oil to drizzle, around 1 tablespoon
  * 1 medium red onion sliced very thin, into 1/8 inch thick slices
  * 1/3 cup pistachios roasted
  * 1-2 oz goat cheese crumbled, or adjust to taste

  **Red wine vinaigrette**

  * 2 tablespoons olive oil
  * 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
  * 1/2 tablespoon honey
  * 1/2 teaspoon dijon mustard or to taste
  * salt to taste
  * black pepper to taste
instructions: >-
  1. Pre-heat your oven to 425 F degrees. Wash and scrub the beets and then trim
  the top and bottom and cut each beet into 2 pieces. I used 6 medium size beets
  here. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and drizzle
  olive oil on top.

  2. Use your hands to coat the beets with the olive oil. Sprinkle some salt and pepper and place the beets on the baking tray with the cut side facing down and bake at 425 F degrees for 25 to 30 minutes or until you can insert a fork easily inside the beet. Time will vary depending on the size of the beets. Bigger beets will take more time.

  3. Once done, let them cool and then peel the skin off. You can use a peeler or the skin can also be easily peeled by hands.Once all the beets are peeled, chop them into small pieces (1/4 to 1/2 inch pieces). Set this aside.

  4. To make the red wine vinaigrette (you should do this while the beets are in the oven), take a glass bowl/jar and to that add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil.

  5. Then add 1/2 tablespoon honey, 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar and 1/2 to 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard.Add salt and black pepper to taste and then use a wire whisk to mix it all together.

  6. Slice a medium red onion into very thin slices (1/8 inch) using a mandoline slicer. You can also use a knife but mandoline slicer makes it much easier and also makes sure that all slices are equal. Transfer the sliced onions along with roasted beets into a large bowl.

  7. Add the prepared red wine vinaigrette to it and mix everything using a spatula. Now, add the roasted pistachios (reserve 1 tablespoon for garnishing later) and mix.

  8. To serve, transfer it to your serving bowl/platter, top with reserved pistachios and crumbled goat cheese. You can add as much goat cheese as you prefer/like. Serve it as an appetizer or as a side.
notes: B﻿eets can be roasted in the air fryer for about 20-30 minutes
