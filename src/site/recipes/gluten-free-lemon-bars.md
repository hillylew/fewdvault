  1. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line the bottom and sides of a 9×13 glass baking
  pan with parchment paper. Make sure the parchment paper hangs over the side of
  the pan to help make lifting the bars out of the pan easier.


  **Shortbread Crust**


  1. In a large bowl mix the melted butter, sugar, pure vanilla extract, and salt. Add the gluten-free flour and stir to completely combine and the dough forms. The dough will be thick. Firmly press the dough into the lined pan evenly top about ½-inch thick. making, sure the layer of crust is even Bake for 20-22 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned. Remove from the oven and set aside.


  **Lemon Filling**


  1. In a large bowl whisk together the eggs. Add the sugar and whisk until combined. Add the lemon juice and pure vanilla extract and whisk until combined. Add the gluten-free flour and whisk until completely combined.

  2. Pour the lemon filling over the warm crust. Bake the bars for 26 minutes or until the center is just about set and no longer jiggles. Remove bars from the oven and cool completely at room temperature for 1 hour. Cover the bars with plastic wrap and place them into the refrigerator for 2 hours, until chilled.

  3. Once the bars are chilled, lift the parchment paper out of the pan using the overhang on the sides of the pan. Dust the top of the bars with powdered sugar and cut into squares before serving. For smoother squares, wipe the knife clean between each row that you cut. Cover and store the leftover lemon bars in the refrigerator. These lemon bars are the best when cold.
