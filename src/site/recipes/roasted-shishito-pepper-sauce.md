ingredients: |-
  * 1 bag Shishito Peppers
  * 1 large shallot, diced
  * 3 Tablespoons EVOO, divided
  * 2-4 Tablespoons Lime Juice
  * 2 Tablespoons Plain Greek Yogurt (or sour cream)
  * 2+ Peeled Garlic Cloves
  * 1/4 teaspoon Sea Salt, or to taste
  * 1/4 teaspoon Ground Black Pepper, or to taste
instructions: >-
  1. Pour 1 tablespoon olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add
  the peppers and shallots, saut√© about 3-5 minutes, turning occasionally until
  they blister on all sides. Remove peppers from heat and slice off the stems
  and discard. 

  2. Combine shishito peppers, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons lime juice, 2 tablespoons greek yogurt, 2 garlic cloves and salt and pepper in a blender. Pulse until desired consistency. 

  3. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired. Makes about 1/2 cup of sauce.

  4. Serving ideas: Dress a Southwestern salad (butter lettuce, corn, beans, tomatoes, red onion and tortilla chips), drizzle over shrimp tacos, or spread on a BLT sandwich
notes: I used 2-3 tbsp sour cream, 5 garlic cloves, and the juice from 2 small
  limes. The browned shallots and twice as much garlic really gave it a good
  flavor, and the lime juice cut the insane heat from the peppers. The sauce
  thickened up a lot in the fridge.
