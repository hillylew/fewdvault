ingredients: |-
  * 1/2 cup quinoa 
  * 1 small onion, finely chopped (1 cup) 
  * 6 oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and finely chopped (1/4 cup) 
  * 1 1/2 cups cooked black beans, or 1 15-oz. can black beans, rinsed and drained, divided 
  * 2 cloves garlic, minced (2 tsp.) 
  * 2 tsp. dried steak seasoning 
  * 8 whole-grain hamburger buns 
instructions: |-
  * Stir together quinoa and 1 1/2 cups water in small saucepan, and season with salt, if desired. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 20 minutes, or until all liquid is absorbed. (You should have 1 1/2 cups cooked quinoa.) 
  * Meanwhile, place onion and sun-dried tomatoes in medium nonstick skillet, and cook over medium heat. (The oil left on the tomatoes should be enough to sauté the onion.) Cook 3 to 4 minutes, or until onion has softened. Stir in 3/4 cup black beans, garlic, steak seasoning, and 11/2 cups water. Simmer 9 to 11 minutes, or until most of liquid has evaporated. 
  * Transfer bean-onion mixture to food processor, add 3/4 cup cooked quinoa, and process until smooth. Transfer to bowl, and stir in remaining 3/4 cup quinoa and remaining 3/4 cup black beans. Season with salt and pepper, if desired, and cool. 
  * Preheat oven to 350°F, and generously coat baking sheet with cooking spray. Shape bean mixture into 8 patties (1/2 cup each), and place on prepared baking sheet. Bake 20 minutes, or until patties are crisp on top. Flip patties with spatula, and bake 10 minutes more, or until both sides are crisp and brown. Serve on buns.
