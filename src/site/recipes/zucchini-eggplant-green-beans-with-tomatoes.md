title:  Zucchini, Eggplant, and Green Beans with Tomatoes
ingredients: |-
  * 3 to 4 large tomatoes, stem end removed 
  * Extra-virgin olive oil 
  * 1 medium onion, cut in half and sliced 
  * 1 medium-large zucchini squash, sliced 
  * 1 medium Japanese eggplant, sliced 
  * 4 large cloves garlic, peeled and sliced thin 
  * Coarse salt and freshly-ground black pepper, to taste 
  * 1 handful of young green beans or Chinese Long Beans, cut into 2-inch lengths 
  * Chicken broth, if needed 
  * Fresh oregano leaves and flowers* 
  * Fresh thyme springs 
  * Pinch saffron 
  * Several shakes of Zatar (optional)** 
instructions: |-
  * If you have an instant hot water tap at your sink, fill a four cup measuring cup with the hot water and add tomatoes. If not, boil water and pour over tomatoes. Let sit a few minutes until you can easily peel off the skins. Cut into quarters and set aside. Learn How To Peel Fresh Tomatoes. 
  * To a large sauté pan, add olive oil and onion, sauté over medium-high heat until onions begin to soften. Add zucchini, eggplant, garlic and green beans, and sauté. Add salt at this time as it helps to release juices from the vegetables. Note: If the vegetables seem dry, add a little chicken broth. Place lid askew on pan and let the mixture cook until almost softened. 
  * Add the peeled tomatoes, oregano, thyme, saffron, and Zatar; toss well, replace lid, and turn heat to low and finish cooking. Taste for seasoning and correct to your taste. If desired, drizzle a little more olive oil over vegetables prior to serving.
