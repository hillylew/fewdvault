ingredients: "<ul><li>1/2 cup rinsed quinoa</li>
	<li>1 medium carrot, cut in large chunks</li>
	<li>6 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
	<li>15 ounces great northern beans, drained and rinsed</li>
	<li>1/4 cup plain dried breadcrumbs</li>
	<li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
	<li>Coarse salt</li>
	<li>Ground pepper</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
	<li>1/2 cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
	<li>4 pitas (each 6 inches)</li>
	<li>1/2 English cucumber, thinly sliced diagonally</li></ul>"
instructions: "<ol><li>In a small saucepan, bring 3/4 cup water to a boil; add quiona, cover, and reduce heat to low. Cook until liquid is absorbed, 12 to 14 minutes; set aside.</li>
	<li>In a food processor, pulse carrot until finely chopped. Add cooked quinoa, half the scallions, beans, breadcrumbs, egg, cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; pulse until combined but still slightly chunky.</li>
	<li>Form mixture into four 3/4-inch-thick paties (dip hands in water to prevent sticking). If too soft, refrigerate 10 minutes to firm. In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium; cook burgers until browned and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes per side.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, and the remaining scallions; season with salt and pepper. Serve burgers in pita topped with cucumber and yogurt sauce.</li></ol>"
