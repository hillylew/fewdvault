ingredients: |-
  * 1 and 1/2 cups **all-purpose flour**
  * 1 teaspoon **ground cinnamon** (optional)
  * 1 teaspoon **baking soda**
  * 1 teaspoon **salt**
  * 1 cup (2 sticks) **unsalted butter**, softened to room temperature
  * 1 cup packed light or dark **brown sugar**
  * 1/2 cup **granulated sugar**
  * 2 large **eggs**, at room temperature
  * 1 Tablespoon **molasses**
  * 2 teaspoons **pure vanilla extract**
  * 3 cups old-fashioned whole rolled **oats**
  * 1 and 3/4 cups semi-sweet **chocolate chips***

  1. Whisk the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl.
  Set aside.

  2. In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle
  attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute.
  Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar and beat on medium-high speed until
  creamed, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs, molasses, and vanilla and beat on high
  speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom
  of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.

  3. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until
  combined. With the mixer running on low speed, beat in the oats and both types
  of chocolate chips. Dough will be thick and sticky. Cover and chill the dough
  for at least 45 minutes in the refrigerator (and up to 4 days). If chilling
  for longer than a few hours, allow to sit at room temperature for at least 30
  minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.

  4. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or
  silicone baking mats. Set aside.

  5. Use a large cookie scoop to scoop the cookie dough, about 3 Tablespoons of
  dough per cookie, and place 4 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for
  13-14 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look
  very soft.

  6. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5
  minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. While the
  cookies are still warm, I like to press a few more chocolate chips into the
  tops – this is only for looks!

  7. Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.
notes: >-
  **\*Chocolate Chips:** I like using 1 and 1/4 cups regular size chocolate
  chips and 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. Varying sizes ensure more chocolate in
  each bite. You can, of course, just use 1 and 3/4 cups regular size chocolate
  chips. You can even try 1 cup chocolate chips and 3/4 cup raisins. Yum!


  **My notes:** I used 1 cup semi-sweet chips, and 3/4 cup butterscotch chips.
  Refrigerating for 1-1.5 hours makes the cookies spread less. I used my 2
  tablespoon cookie scoop, heaping scoops yields about 36 cookies. Smaller
  cookies should bake for 9-10 minutes.

Made with oats, butter, and brown sugar, you are guaranteed the softest and chewiest **oatmeal chocolate chip cookies**. Use this perfect oatmeal cookie as the base for other add-ins such as raisins, dried cranberries, and nuts. Cinnamon and a touch of molasses add that little something extra. These are the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies!
