ingredients: |-
  * 1/2 cup warm water (110-115 degrees F)
  * 1 tablespoon honey
  * 1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast
  * 1 cup whole milk, room temperature
  * 2 teaspoons salt
  * 2 tablespoons oil
  * 3 cups bread flour
  * 1 1/2 cups dark rye flour
  * 2 tablespoons whole caraway seeds
instructions: >-
  1. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with a hook attachment,
  combine the warm water and honey, then sprinkle the yeast on top of the water
  and let it proof for 5 minutes.

  2. Add the milk, salt, oil, bread flour, whole wheat flour, rye flour, and caraway seeds to the yeast mixture and knead on medium-low speed until the dough starts to come together. I always start with the lower amount of bread and whole wheat flours listed, then add more as needed.

  3. Increase the speed to medium-high and knead for 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and no longer sticking to the sides of the bowl.

  4. Place the dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl and cover with a towel.  Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.

  5. When the dough has risen, punch it down and transfer to a clean work surface.  Let it rest for 5 minutes, then shape it into a loaf and transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Cover with a towel and let rise for another hour until doubled in size again. 

  6. When the dough is close to being doubled in size, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.  Slash the dough with a sharp knife to create gashes on top.  Open the oven and throw a few ice cubes on the bottom when you place the bread in to bake.  This will create steam that will make for a great crust to the bread.  Bake for 30 minutes until crusty and golden brown.
notes: >-
  1. Rye flour has a lower gluten content than regular flour, so it will
  typically take a little longer to rise than other loaves.

  2. I tried the recipe with 1 1/2 cups of bread flour, 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour, and 1 1/2 cups of rye flour, but I found it very dense.
