ingredients: |-
  **Chocolate Cake**

  * 1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
  * 3/4 cup unsweetened natural cocoa powder
  * 1 and 3/4 cups granulated sugar
  * 2 teaspoons baking soda
  * 1 teaspoon baking powder
  * 1 teaspoon salt
  * optional: 2 teaspoons espresso powder
  * 1/2 cup canola or vegetable oil
  * 2 large eggs, at room temperature
  * 3/4 cup full fat sour cream, at room temperature
  * 1/2 cup buttermilk, at room temperature
  * 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
  * 1/3 cup boiling hot water

  **Cream Cheese Filling**

  * 12 ounces full-fat block cream cheese, softened to room temperature
  * 1 large egg
  * 1/4 cup granulated sugar
  * 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

  **Additional toppings**

  Homemade salted caramel topping, chocolate ganache, or fruit.
instructions: >-
  1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and grease a 10-inch bundt pan that holds
  12 cups of batter.

  2. Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using) together in a large bowl. Set aside.

  3. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or you can use a whisk) mix the oil, eggs, sour cream, buttermilk, and vanilla together until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot water, and whisk or beat it all until the batter is completely combined. Set aside as you prepare the cream cheese filling.

  4. Make the cream cheese filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on high speed until no lumps remain. Beat in the remaining ingredients on medium-high speed until combined.

  5. Pour half of the chocolate batter evenly into the prepared bundt pan. Spread all of the cream cheese filling evenly on top. The cream cheese batter is thick, so you’ll have to spoon it on top and do your best to spread it around– avoid it touching the sides of the pan. Pour the remaining chocolate batter evenly on top.

  6. Bake for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean with just a couple lightly moist crumbs. This is a large, heavy cake so don’t be alarmed if it takes a little longer in your oven.

  7. Once done, remove from the oven and allow to cool for 2 hours inside the pan. Then, invert the slightly cooled bundt cake onto a wire rack or serving dish. Allow cake to cool completely, then refrigerate for 2 hours. Garnish with optional toppings, then slice and serve.

  8. Leftovers keep well stored in the refrigerator for a few days.
notes: "**Hot Water:** Instead of boiling water, try using hot and strong black
  coffee. The cake won’t taste like coffee, but the chocolate flavor will
  definitely be accentuated. I reduced the amount down from 1/2 cup (120ml) to
  1/3 cup (80ml) to yield a thicker cake batter which helps support the cream
  cheese layer."
