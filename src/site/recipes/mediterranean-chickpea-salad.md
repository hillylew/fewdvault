  1. Make salad: In a large bowl, toss together chickpeas, cucumber, bell

  Recipe is easy to cut in half. I used a whole small lemon for half the
  dressing.

Thanks to the chickpeas, this salad will keep you full for hours. It's satisfying in a way that leafy greens never could be. Sorry not sorry, kale.
