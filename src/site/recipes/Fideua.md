ingredients: |-
  * 2 Tbs. olive oil, divided 
  * 8 oz. angel hair pasta, broken into 2-inch lengths (2 cups) 
  * 1 medium onion, chopped (1 1/2 cups) 
  * 2 cups sliced wild mushroom mix (such as fresh shiitake, cremini, and oyster mushrooms) 
  * 1/2 8-oz. pkg. soy chorizo (1 sausage), halved and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices, optional 
  * 1 small red bell pepper, cut into chunks 
  * 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, divided 
  * 3 cloves garlic, minced (1 Tbs.) 
  * 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika 
  * 1 8-oz. can sodium-free tomato sauce 
  * 2 cups mushroom broth or low-sodium vegetable broth 
  * 8 oz. fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces 
instructions: |-
  1. Heat 1 Tbs. oil in wok, paella pan, or large skillet over medium heat. Add pasta, and cook 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned and opaque, stirring constantly. Transfer pasta to paper-towel-lined plate to drain. 
  2. Add remaining 1 Tbs. oil to pan, and heat over medium heat. Add onion, and cook 3 to 4 minutes, or until soft. Stir in mushrooms, soy chorizo (if using), bell pepper, 2 Tbs. parsley, garlic, and smoked paprika, and cook 5 to 7 minutes, or until most liquid has evaporated. 
  3. Stir in tomato sauce. Add pasta, broth, and 1/2 cup water, and season with salt and pepper, if desired. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add asparagus, and cover; simmer 3 minutes. 
  4. Preheat oven to broil. If using wok or skillet, transfer pasta mixture to 10-inch or larger round cake pan. Place paella pan or cake pan under broiler, and broil 3 to 4 minutes, or just until pasta is crisp on top. (Watch carefully-it burns quickly.) Sprinkle with remaining 2 Tbs. parsley. 
notes: |-
  5oz spaghetti subbed, diced tomatoes instead of sauce, 5 cloves garlic, used field roast Mexican sausage but should try chorizo seitan<br>
  Start with softening onions in oil, add everything but asparagus, boil for 5 minutes, cover and let simmer until peppers are soft, add asparagus<br>
  Try broiling for longer than 5 minutes
