ingredients: |-
  * 2 Tablespoons vegetable oil
  * 1 small yellow onion, chopped
  * 1 red bell pepper, chopped
  * 1 clove garlic, minced
  * 3 Tablespoons cornstarch
  * 6 cups low sodium chicken broth
  * 2 cups chopped or shredded cooked chicken
  * 12 oz. mild cheddar cheese, shredded
  * 2 corn tortillas, chopped into small pieces
  * 3 Tablespoons fresh lime juice
  * 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
  * 1 can diced green chiles
  * 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
  * 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (optional)
  * 1/2 teaspoon oregano
  * 3/4 teaspoon salt
  * Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnish
  * Tortilla strips or chips, for garnish
instructions: >-
  1. In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and pepper and cook
  until translucent, 6-7 minutes. Add garlic and cook an additional minute,
  until fragrant.

  2. Dissolve the cornstarch in the chicken broth then add it to the pot. Add the chicken, cheese, chopped tortillas, lime juice, diced tomatoes, green chiles, cumin, cayenne, oregano, and salt. Increase the heat to medium high and stir frequently as the cheese melts. Be sure to run your spatula along the bottom of the pan occasionally to ensure the cheese isn't sticking to the bottom.

  3. When the cheese is melted and the soup begins to bubble, reduce the heat to low and allow to simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tortillas are very soft and mostly melted into the soup. Serve with tortilla chips and fresh cilantro.


  **Tortilla Strips**


  1. C﻿hop 4-8 corn tortillas into strips.

  2. F﻿ry in oil until browned

  3. C﻿ool on paper towels
