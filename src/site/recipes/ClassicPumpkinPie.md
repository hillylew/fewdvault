ingredients: "<strong>Pie Crust</strong>
	<ul>
  <li>1 cup Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon shortening</li>
	<li>2 to 3 tablespoons cold water</li>
  </ul>
	<strong>Filling</strong>
	<ul>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
	<li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
	<li>1/8 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
	<li>1 can (15 oz) pumpkin (not pumpkin pie mix)</li>
	<li>1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk</li>
  </ul>
	<strong>Spiced Cream Clouds</strong>
	<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup whipping cream</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice or ground cinnamon</li>
  </ul>"
instructions: "<ol>
	<li>In medium bowl, mix flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost leaves side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).</li>
	<li>Gather pastry into a ball. On lightly floured surface, shape dough into flattened round. Wrap pastry in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable.</li>
	<li>Heat oven to 425°F. On lightly floured surface, roll pastry with floured rolling pin into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1 inch from rim of pie plate. Fold and roll pastry under, even with plate; flute as desired.</li>
	<li>In medium bowl, beat eggs slightly with wire whisk. Beat in remaining filling ingredients. Place pastry-lined pie plate on oven rack to prevent spilling the filling. Pour filling into pie plate. Cover edge of crust with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.</li>
	<li>Bake 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Bake about 45 minutes longer, removing foil during last 15 minutes of baking, until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 30 minutes. Refrigerate about 4 hours or until chilled.</li>
	<li>In chilled small bowl, beat topping ingredients with electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form. Serve pie topping with whipped cream.</li>
  </ol>"
