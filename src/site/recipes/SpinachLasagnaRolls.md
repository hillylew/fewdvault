ingredients: |-
  * 9 lasagna noodles, cooked 
  * 10 oz frozen chopped spinach, thawed and completely drained 
  * 15 oz fat free ricotta cheese (I like Polly-o) 
  * 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
  * 1 egg 
  * salt and fresh pepper 
  * 32 oz tomato sauce 
  * 9 tbsp (about 3 oz) part skim mozzarella cheese, shredded 
instructions: |-
  * Preheat oven to 350Â°. Combine spinach, ricotta, Parmesan, egg, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Ladle about 1 cup sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 12 baking dish. 
  * Place a piece of wax paper on the counter and lay out lasagna noodles. Make sure noodles are dry. Take 1/3 cup of ricotta mixture and spread evenly over noodle. Roll carefully and place seam side down onto the baking dish. Repeat with remaining noodles. 
  * Ladle sauce over the noodles in the baking dish and top each one with 1 tbsp mozzarella cheese. Put foil over baking dish and bake for 40 minutes, or until cheese melts. Makes 9 rolls. 
  * To serve, ladle a little sauce on the plate and top with lasagna roll. 
notes: Added 1 whole bag Morningstar crumbles and whole wheat lasagna noodles, made 12 rolls and it was perfect. Can use 24oz sauce instead of 32oz.
