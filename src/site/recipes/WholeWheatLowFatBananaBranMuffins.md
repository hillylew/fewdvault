ingredients: "<ul><li>1/4 cup applesauce, unsweetened</li>
	<li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
	<li>3 bananas, mashed</li>
	<li>1/4 cup milk</li>
	<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
	<li>1 egg</li>
	<li>1 cup flour (1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 all-purpose)</li>
	<li>1 cup wheat bran</li>
	<li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
	<li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
	<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
	<li>rolled oats (garnish)</li></ul>"
instructions: "<ol><li>Preheat oven to 375ºF (190ºC). Prepare a muffin pan with grease or paper liners. (I’ve tried both, and the paper liners tend to stick too much because of the low fat content of the muffin.) Toast rolled oats in oven while preparing batter (or do it ahead of time, but keep an eye on them).</li>
	<li>Combine flour, bran, baking soda, baking powder, and salt, and set aside. In a large bowl, cream applesauce and brown sugar until well mixed. Add bananas, milk, vanilla and egg. Stir in dry ingredients, blending slowly until just mixed. Pour batter into prepared muffin pan and top with toasted oats.</li>
	<li>Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li></ol>"
notes: Maybe use flaxseed egg replacer
