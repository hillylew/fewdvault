  * 1 1/2 cups wheat bran 
  * 1 cup nonfat milk 
  * 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce

instructions: |-
  * Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or use paper muffin liners. Mix together wheat bran and milk, and let stand for 10 minutes. 
  * In a large bowl, mix together applesauce, egg, brown sugar, and vanilla. Beat in bran mixture. Sift together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Stir into bran mixture until just blended. Fold in blueberries. Scoop into muffin cups. 
  * Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tops spring back when lightly tapped. 
notes: Doubled recipe, put slightly more than a cup of blueberries and cranberries (each) that were frozen and sat on the counter for ~45 mins, heaping cup of applesauce, sprinkled oats on top for cute points.
