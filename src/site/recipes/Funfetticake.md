ingredients: |-
  **Cake**
  * 1 2/3 cup all-purpose flour, careful not to overmeasure 
  * 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
  * 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt 
  * 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted 
  * 3/4 cup granulated sugar 
  * 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 
  * 1 large egg 
  * 1/4 cup yogurt (plain or vanilla; or greek yogurt; or sour cream) 
  * 3/4 cup milk (cow's milk; or soy milk; or almond milk) 
  * 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract 
  * 2/3 cup sprinkles (not nonpareils)  
  **Vanilla Buttercream**
  * 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature 
  * 3 to 4 cups powdered (confectioners) sugar 
  * 1/4 cup heavy cream (see note above about substituting milk or half-and-half) 
  * 2 and 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
  * salt, as needed 
instructions: |-
  **Cake**
  * Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Spray a 9-inch springform or baking pan (round or square) generously with nonstick spray. Set aside. 
  * In a medium bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt butter in the microwave. Whisk in the sugars vigorously getting out any brown sugar lumps - mixture will be gritty. Whisk in egg, yogurt, milk, and vanilla extract until combined. Slowly mix in dry ingredients until no lumps remain. Batter will be thick. Slowly stir in sprinkles, but do not overmix because the sprinkles will bleed their color. 
  * Pour/spoon batter into prepared cake pan. This cake takes around 33-37 minutes to bake. What I suggest is to bake it for 20 minutes, then cover loosely with aluminum foil (loosely to avoid the top from sticking to the foil) and continue baking for 13-17 more minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool.  
  **Frosting**
  * To make the frosting, beat softened butter on medium speed with an electric or stand mixer. Beat for 3 minutes until smooth and creamy. Add powdered sugar, cream, and vanilla extract with the mixer running. Increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes. Add more powdered sugar if frosting is too thin or more cream if mixture is too thick. Add 1/4 teaspoon (or more) if frosting is too sweet. Frost cooled cake as desired and top with sprinkles. There may be leftover frosting depending how much you wish to use. 
  * Cake stays fresh covered at room temperature or in the refrigerator for 5 days. 
notes: |-
  * Interested in making a layer cake? You could: (1) Bake the cake as indicated and slice the cake horizontally to create two layers. Double the frosting if desired. (2) Double the cake recipe and bake in two separate 9-inch cake pans. Fill the pans only 1/2 way full and use any extra batter to make cupcakes. Double the frosting recipe as well. 
  * Try using this recipe to make standard size cupcakes or into 24+ mini cupcakes, baking for just 8-9 minutes. You can also try this cake with my milk chocolate frosting. 
  * For a 9x13 pan, double the recipe, fill pan halfway with batter, use any extra batter to make a few cupcakes (around a 20 minute bake time for cupcakes). This size cake will take around 30-35 minutes.
