ingredients: |-
  * 1 tbsp olive oil 1 small onion chopped
  *  1 medium carrot chopped
  *  1/2 cup Arborio rice *
  *  4 cups chicken broth low sodium
  *  3 tbsp lemon juice freshly squeezed
  *  3 eggs
  *  2 chicken breast cooked and shredded with 2 forks, skinless and boneless
  *  1/2 tsp salt or to taste
  *  1 tsp pepper or to taste
  *  1/4 cup dill chopped
instructions: >-
  1. Saute veggies: Heat the oil in a soup pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat
  then add the chopped onion and carrot and cook for about 5 minutes or just
  until the carrot is tender and the onion is translucent.

  2. Add rice and broth: Add the rice and chicken broth to the pot and bring to a
  boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for about 15 minutes or until the
  rice is cooked through.

  3. Prepare eggs with lemon juice: Meanwhile in a small bowl beat the egg together
  with lemon juice.

  4. Finish the soup: Add the shredded chicken to the pot, then add about a ladle
  of the soup broth to the egg mixture and stir. Pour the egg mixture into the
  soup. You will notice the soup thickening up. Season with salt and pepper as
  needed and if you feel the soup needs more lemon, add more lemon juice as
  desired.

  5. Garnish and serve: Garnish with lots of dill, with some feta cheese and lemon
  slices if you prefer, then serve.
