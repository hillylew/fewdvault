ingredients: |-
  * 1 cup **water**, warmed to about 110°F
  * 1/4 cup **whole milk**, warmed to about 110°F
  * 2 and 1/4 teaspoons Platinum Yeast by Red Star *(1 standard packet)*
  * 2 Tablespoons **granulated sugar**
  * 4 Tablespoons **unsalted butter**, softened to room temperature
  * 1 and 1/2 teaspoons **salt**
  * 3 and 1/4 cups **all-purpose flour** or **bread flour**
instructions: >-


  1. **Prepare the dough:** Whisk the warm water, warm milk, yeast, and sugar
  together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle
  attachment. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes.

  2. Add the butter, salt, and 1 cup flour. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds,
  scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, then add another cup
  of flour. Beat on medium speed until relatively incorporated (there may still
  be chunks of butter). Add the remaining flour and beat on medium speed until
  the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 2
  minutes.

  3. **Knead the dough:** Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional
  2 minutes or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 2 minutes. 

  4. **1st Rise:**Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil or nonstick spray.
  Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover
  the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the
  dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1-2 hours or until double
  in size. 

  5. Grease a 9×5 inch loaf pan.

  6. **Shape the bread:** When the dough is ready, punch it down to release the
  air. Lightly flour a work surface, your hands, and a rolling pin. Roll the
  dough out into a large rectangle, about 8×15 inches. It does not have to be
  perfect– in fact, it will probably be rounded on the edges. That’s ok! Roll it
  up into an 8 inch log and place in the prepared loaf pan.

  7. **2nd Rise:** Cover shaped loaf with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a
  clean kitchen towel. Allow to rise until it’s about 1 inch above the top of
  the loaf pan, about 1 hour. 

  8. Adjust oven rack to a lower position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).
  *(It’s best to bake the bread towards the bottom of the oven so the top
  doesn’t burn.)*

  9. **Bake the bread:** Bake for 30-34 minutes or until golden brown on top. If
  you gently tap on the loaf, it should sound hollow. If you notice the top
  browning too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil. (I usually add
  aluminum foil over the loaf around the 20 minute mark.) Remove from the oven
  and allow bread to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Feel
  free to let it cool completely before slicing, too.

  10. Cover leftover bread tightly and store at room temperature for 2-3 days or
  in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.
