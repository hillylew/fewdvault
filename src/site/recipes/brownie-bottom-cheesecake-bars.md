ingredients: |-
  **Brownie Layer**

  * 4 large eggs
  * 2 cups sugar
  * 3/4 cup butter, melted
  * 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
  * 1 1/2 cups flour
  * 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
  * 1/4 teaspoon salt
  * 1/3 cup cocoa

  **Cheesecake Layer**

  * 16 ounces (2 large bars) cream cheese, softened
  * 1/2 cup sugar
  * 2 eggs
  * 1/4 cup sour cream
  * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
instructions: >-
  1. Make Brownie Layer-Lightly beat eggs then add sugar, butter and vanilla.
  Stir well till all combined and butter does not separate from mixture.

  2. Sift together flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Add flour mixture to
  egg mixture in thirds. mix just until all blended.

  3. Spoon into a greased and floured 9 x 13 pan. (I line my pan with parchment
  paper.) Spread to edges. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 15-20 minutes, just
  until crust starts to form on top.

  4. While brownies are baking prepare cheesecake layer-In a mixing bowl, beat
  cream cheese until smooth. Add in sour cream and sugar and beat again.

  5. Add eggs, one at a time, to cream cheese mixture, beating well after each
  addition. Add vanilla extract and beat one more time.

  6. Spoon mixture on top of pre baked brownie bottom, smoothing to completely
  brownie layer. Return to oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, until center no
  longer wobbles and edges are just starting to turn golden.

  7. Remove from oven and let cool completely before refrigerating. Chill for at
  least 2 hours before serving.
notes: >-
  After 15 minutes, I added the cheesecake and it sunk in the middle. Cook the
  brownie layer longer than just a film forming on top.
