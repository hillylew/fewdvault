instructions: >-
  1. Spray a non-stick formed aluminum bundt pan with cooking spray (see above)
  and preheat your oven to 350-degrees. Mix first six ingredients together with
  a beater. Fold in white chocolate chips.

  2. Fill prepared bundt pan with half of the batter. Spoon half of the
  raspberry filling in small, separated teaspoon-sized spoonfuls over the batter
  (so it looks like separate tiny clumps of filling over the top). Using a knife
  swirl the filling through the cake.

  3. Pour remaining batter in evenly and spoon in remaining pie filling,
  repeating the "swirling" process above.

  4. Cook in oven at 350 degrees for 45-50 mins. (do the "knife test" to
  determine doneness). If the knife does not come out clean, keep placing back
  in the oven for 3-5 min at a time until it does.

  5. Remove from oven. Let cool for 20 mins. Remove from pan. I think it tastes
  most like a Nothing Bundt Cake if you put it on a serving plate, wrap it well
  in Saran Wrap, and let it sit overnight in the freezer before frosting and
  serving.

  6. In a medium bowl, cream together the cream cheese and butter until creamy.
  Mix in the vanilla, then gradually stir in the powdered sugar (start with 2
  cups then keep adding more until it is nice and thick).

  7. Note: To get the frosting like in the picture. Fill a gallon size Ziplock
  bag with the frosting and chill for about 30 minutes. Cut off a bottom corner
  at about a half inch diagonal cut, depending on how big you want the "frosting
  strips". Frost cake by squeezing out the frosting from the outside of the cake
  toward the middle.
notes: This can be made in a sheet pan very easily. Do not overcook!
