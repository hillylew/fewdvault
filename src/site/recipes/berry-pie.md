ingredients: |-
  **Crust**
  * 3 Cups All-Purpose Flour 
  * 1 Cup (Leaf) Lard 
  * 2 Pinches Salt 
  * 8 T Ice Water 
  * 1 Egg + 2 tbsp water (optional for brushing top crust) 
  **Filling**
  * 8 + cups blackberries, rinsed, picked clean, patted dry (if you use frozen berries, defrost and drain them) 
  * 3/4 to 1 cup sugar (depending on how sweet your berries are) 
  * 2 teaspoon lemon juice (use 3 teaspoons if using store-bought berries) 
  * 1 teaspoon lemon zest 
  * 1/4 teaspoon almond extract 
  * 4 to 6 Tbsp cornstarch, flour, or ground quick cooking instant tapioca (use 4 Tbsp if making the pie with wild-picked berries that include a few not fully ripe berries, 6 Tbsp if making the pie with store-bought very ripe berries) 
instructions: |-
  **Crust**
  * In a medium to large mixing bowl, mix together the flour and the salt.  Add the Lard and using a Pastry Blender, mix until the lard and the flour mixture combine to the consistency of gritty pea-sized or a bit smaller pieces. 
  * Using a glass full of ice water, measure out 1 T water at a time, adding it to the flour and lard mixture and stirring with a spoon or your hands.  Do this, up to 8 T water, until the dough sticks together to form a ball.  It should be sticky and not dried out, but hold its shape easily. 
  * Split the dough ball into two equal halves, forming each one into a ball.  Wrap the dough balls in parchment or wax paper or plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes or so.
  * This is the point at which you can always freeze the dough as well. 
  **Filling**
  * Place blackberries, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, cinnamon, almond extract, and cornstarch/flour/or ground instant tapioca in a large bowl. Gently fold the berries until they are all well coated with sugar. Let sit for 30 minutes. 
  * Preheat oven to 450°F. 
  * Roll out the dough for the bottom into a butter-greased pie pan. Leave about 1 inch hanging over the edge. 
  * Add filling to bottom crust. 
  * Roll out top crust. Either lay it on top of the filling and cut a few slits to vent, or arrange into a lattice, or use cutouts to add on top. If using entire top layer, leave an inch overhang. 
  * Roll crust overhang up and scallop edges of the crust. 
  * Brush the crust with the egg wash. 
  * (Optional) Dust the crust with granulated sugar. 
  * Cover edges with a silicone crust protector. 
  * Bake at 450° for 30 minutes, then reduce heat to 350° for another 30+ minutes until the filling is bubbling. 
  * Let rest until cool to touch before slicing.

Recipe is for the mixed (or not) berry pie with a lard crust. The crust recipe leaves plenty of leftovers that can be frozen for another time.
