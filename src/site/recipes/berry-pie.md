ingredients: >-
  <strong>Crust</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>3 Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
  <li>1 Cup (Leaf) Lard</li>
  <li>2 Pinches Salt</li>
  <li>8 T Ice Water</li>
  <li>1 Egg + 2 tbsp water (optional for brushing top crust)</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Filling</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>8 + cups blackberries, rinsed, picked clean, patted dry (if you use frozen berries, defrost and drain them)</li>
  <li>3/4 to 1 cup sugar (depending on how sweet your berries are)</li>
  <li>2 teaspoon lemon juice (use 3 teaspoons if using store-bought berries)</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>
  <li>4 to 6 Tbsp cornstarch, flour, or ground quick cooking instant tapioca (use 4 Tbsp if making the pie with wild-picked berries that include a few not fully ripe berries, 6 Tbsp if making the pie with store-bought very ripe berries)</li>
  </ul>
instructions:
  <strong>Crust</strong>
  <ol>
  <li>In a medium to large mixing bowl, mix together the flour and the salt.  Add the Lard and using a Pastry Blender, mix until the lard and the flour mixture combine to the consistency of gritty pea-sized or a bit smaller pieces.</li>
  <li>Using a glass full of ice water, measure out 1 T water at a time, adding it to the flour and lard mixture and stirring with a spoon or your hands.  Do this, up to 8 T water, until the dough sticks together to form a ball.  It should be sticky and not dried out, but hold its shape easily.</li>
  <li>Split the dough ball into two equal halves, forming each one into a ball.  Wrap the dough balls in parchment or wax paper or plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes or so.
  <li>This is the point at which you can always freeze the dough as well.</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Filling</strong>
  <ol>
  <li>Place blackberries, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, cinnamon, almond extract, and cornstarch/flour/or ground instant tapioca in a large bowl. Gently fold the berries until they are all well coated with sugar. Let sit for 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Preheat oven to 450°F.</li>
  <li>Roll out the dough for the bottom into a butter-greased pie pan. Leave about 1 inch hanging over the edge.</li>
  <li>Add filling to bottom crust.</li>
  <li>Roll out top crust. Either lay it on top of the filling and cut a few slits to vent, or arrange into a lattice, or use cutouts to add on top. If using entire top layer, leave an inch overhang.</li>
  <li>Roll crust overhang up and scallop edges of the crust.</li>
  <li>Brush the crust with the egg wash.</li>
  <li>(Optional) Dust the crust with granulated sugar.</li>
  <li>Cover edges with a silicone crust protector.</li>
  <li>Bake at 450° for 30 minutes, then reduce heat to 350° for another 30+ minutes until the filling is bubbling.</li>
  <li>Let rest until cool to touch before slicing.</li>
  </ol>

Recipe is for the mixed (or not) berry pie with a lard crust. The crust recipe leaves plenty of leftovers that can be frozen for another time.
