A crisp is the way to go when you’re not in the mood (or don’t have time) to deal with pie dough—it’s an easy route to a memorable dessert. Here, the straightforward filling is a mixture of brown sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, vanilla, and fresh peaches. Dump everything into a baking dish and top with a generous layer of crunchy oat-and-brown-sugar streusel. Serve with scoops of Cinnamon Ice Cream or a mound of Easy Whipped Cream for a simple end to a warm summer day.
