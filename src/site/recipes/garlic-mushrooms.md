ingredients: |-
  * 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
  * 1 tablespoon olive oil
  * 1/2 an onion chopped (optional)
  * 1 serrano pepper chopped (optional)
  * 1 pound (500 g) Cremini or button mushrooms
  * 2 tablespoons dry white wine* (optional)
  * 1 teaspoon (fresh) thyme leaves chopped
  * 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (chives work in a pinch)
  * 4 cloves garlic minced
  * Salt and pepper to taste
instructions: >-
  1. Heat the butter and oil in a large pan or skillet over medium-high heat.

  2. Sauté the onion (and pepper) until softened (about 3 minutes).

  3. Add the mushrooms and cook until golden and crispy on the edges.

  4. Pour in the wine and cook for 2 minutes, to reduce slightly. If the
  mushrooms need no deglazing, you can skip this step.

  5. Stir through thyme, 1 tablespoon of parsley and garlic. Cook for a further
  30 seconds, until fragrant.

  6. Season generously with salt and pepper (to your taste).

  7. Sprinkle with remaining parsley and serve warm.
