  Dry zucchini extremely well.<br>
  Walnuts or pecans work well. <br>
  Omit raisins. <br>
  Use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 1/2 granulated sugar for more depth.<br>
  To make Pina colada zucchini bread: add 1 cup of sweetened, shredded coconut. Reserve 1/4 cup for sprinkling the top. Reduce sugar to 1 1/2 cups total (1 granulated, 1/2 brown). Omit nutmeg and cinnamon, optionally add 1/2 tsp rum extract.
