ingredients: |-
  * 2 tablespoons yeast 
  * 2 tablespoons sugar 
  * 3/4 tablespoon salt 
  * 2 cups hot water (not boiling) 
  * 2 tablespoons olive oil 
  * 4 to 5 cups flour 
  * cornmeal (optional) 
instructions: |-
  1. Using a Bosch or Kitchen Aid mixer, put yeast, sugar, salt, hot water, and olive oil in the mixer. 
  2. Gradually add the flour until the dough has sufficiently scraped everything off the sides of the mixing bowl. Continue to mix on low for 8-10 minutes. 
  3. Remove and cover with plastic wrap - let the dough rise until doubles in size (about 30 minutes). 
  4. Grease 2 cookie sheets and sprinkle with corn meal. Punch down the dough and make tennis ball-size dough balls (about 8-12, depending on how large you want your bread bowls). Place on cookie sheet with no more than 6 to a cookie sheet (don't let them touch).  
  5. Let them rise for another 30 minutes. Bake each cookie sheet at 400 for 18 minutes. 
notes: 11 makes them too small, probably 6-8 is just right.
