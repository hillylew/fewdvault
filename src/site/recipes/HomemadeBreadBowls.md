ingredients: "<ul><li>2 tablespoons yeast</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
	<li>3/4 tablespoon salt</li>
	<li>2 cups hot water (not boiling)</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
	<li>4 to 5 cups flour</li>
	<li>cornmeal (optional)</li></ul>"
instructions: "<ol><li>Using a Bosch or Kitchen Aid mixer, put yeast, sugar, salt, hot water, and olive oil in the mixer.</li>
<li>Gradually add the flour until the dough has sufficiently scraped everything off the sides of the mixing bowl. Continue to mix on low for 8-10 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove and cover with plastic wrap - let the dough rise until doubles in size (about 30 minutes).</li>
<li>Grease 2 cookie sheets and sprinkle with corn meal. Punch down the dough and make tennis ball-size dough balls (about 8-12, depending on how large you want your bread bowls). Place on cookie sheet with no more than 6 to a cookie sheet (don't let them touch). </li>
<li>Let them rise for another 30 minutes. Bake each cookie sheet at 400 for 18 minutes.</li></ol>"
notes: 11 makes them too small, probably 6-8 is just right.
