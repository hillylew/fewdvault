ingredients: |-
  * 8 soft taco size spinach tortillas (or corn, your preference. I use what’s on hand) 
  * 2 cups shredded Monterrey jack cheese, divided* 
  * 2 cups cut chicken substitute (I like Quorn brand) 
  * 2 handfuls of fresh, washed spinach 
  * 3 tablespoons butter* 
  * 3 tablespoons flour 
  * 2 cups veggie broth 
  * 1 cup sour cream* 
  * 1 (4 oz) can diced green chiles** 
  * 1 (4 oz) can diced jalapenos** 
  * Chopped, fresh cilantro and diced tomatoes/ fresh salsa for garnish 
instructions: |-
  * Preheat oven to 425 degrees. 
  * In a large saucepan, melt the butter. Add the flour; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add the veggie broth, whisk until smooth. Cook over medium heat until sauce is thick and bubbly. Stir in sour cream, green chiles & jalapeno. Remove from heat. 
  * Wrap tortillas (3 at a time) in a wet paper towel and steam in the microwave or on the stove for a few seconds to make them pliable. 
  * Put a layer of your prepared sauce on the bottom of your pan 
  * Distribute the “chicken,” Spinach, cheese & spooned sauce (about a tablespoon in each) evenly among the tortillas. Roll up and place seam side down in the pan. 
  * Spoon the sauce in an even layer over the enchiladas. Don’t drown, though or it’ll be mushy. You may have extra sauce. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake covered for 20 minutes or until bubbly. 
  * Garnish with cilantro & tomatoes/salsa. Serve and enjoy with rice & vegetarian beans! 
notes: I omitted jalapenos, ended up with too much filling so I made 10 enchiladas.

Since cinco de mayo (<— no typo) is one of my fave celebrations, from the parades, to the  *ahem* drinking, to the food, it’s a great excuse for me to get in the kitchen and throw down for the friends and fam. If you’re looking for a crowd pleasing recipe, this one never fails. Of course all of the vegetarian-friendly ingredients can be swapped out for vegan options (or for meat-lovers, for that matter).  - See more at: http://sassynation.tumblr.com/post/22455902926/sassy-nation-exclusive-sassy-appetit-vegetarian-enchilad#sthash.lYRq8nQi.dpuf
