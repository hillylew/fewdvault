ingredients: |-
  **Pasta**

  * 1 medium onion 
  * 2 garlic cloves 
  * 2 14oz cans diced tomatoes 
  * 5 oz mascarpone 
  * 1 tsp Italian seasoning 
  * salt and pepper 
  * Parmesan curls 
  * fresh basil  
  **Garlic bread** 
  * ciabatta 
  * 2 oz butter

  * 1 large garlic clove 
  * 1 spring onion 
  * flat-leaf parsley 
  * salt and pepper 
instructions: |-
  * All my sauces start with a finely minced onion and garlic. I’m boring, I know. Heat some olive oil and sauté the onion for a minute or 4, until translucent. Add the garlic and give it another minute before pouring in the diced tomatoes. Season with a pinch of salt, loads of freshly cracked black pepper and a tsp or so Italian seasoning. Bring the sauce to a boil and let it simmer, over low heat, for 30 minutes. 
  * Gives us time to make the flavored butter. Tastiest is to also make your own butter! Use a food processor and combine the olive oil, butter, a large handful of fresh basil and a few parsley leaves (1:3 ratio). Add the grated garlic and a spring onion. Pulse until you have a lovely green flavored butter. 
  * I opted for 3 small ciabattas but a large one works just as well. Slice it in half and spread the butter on the bottom half. Put the halves back together and bake them in a preheated oven at 375ºC (175ºF) 5 to 7 minutes. Want to up the flavors a little. Feel free to sprinkle some cheese on top of the butter. 
  * Boil the pasta in salted water according to the directions on the package. After 30 minutes the tomato sauce will have cooked down quite a bit. Stir in the mascarpone. Taste to check the seasoning. Add more salt and pepper when needed. Finish the sauce with lots of finely minced fresh basil. Drain the pasta and stir it into the sauce adding a little of the cooking liquid as well. 
  * Finish the pasta with lots of Parmesan curls and a few basil leaves. The mascarpone adds a wonderful richness and sweetness that really compliments the tanginess of the tomatoes. The garlic, onion and fresh basil perform the rest of the magic. 
  * La Dolce Vita. Simple, pure, and irresistible.

It’s a combination of flavors that’s highly addictive, and I’m so not exaggerating. You should see what happens when I hand a plate full of this to my kid! He opens that tiny mouth and just shoves two servings right in there.
When it’s summer I crave simple, pure, and easy-to-prepare foods. Nothing too complicated, just laid-back dishes that we can eat alfresco. This pasta is one of those simple and mellow recipes that I fall back on time and time again.
Key thing for this wonderfully rich sauce and bread is to use fresh herbs. Bright green and super fresh. Lots and lots of them.
