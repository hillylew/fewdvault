ingredients: "<ul><li>4 flour tortillas (10 inches)</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
	<li>1 large onion, diced</li>
	<li>1 jalapeno chile, minced (remove seeds and ribs for less heat)</li>
	<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
	<li>Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
	<li>2 cans (15 ounces each) black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
	<li>12 ounces beer, or 1 1/2 cups water</li>
	<li>1 package (10 ounces) frozen corn</li>
	<li>4 scallions, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish</li>
	<li>8 ounces cheddar cheese, shredded (2 1/2 cups)</li></ul>"
instructions: "<ol><li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. With a paring knife, trim tortillas to fit a 9-inch springform pan. Use the bottom of the pan as a guide. Set aside.</li>
	<li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, jalapeno, garlic, and cumin; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
	<li>Add beans and beer, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; simmer until liquid has almost evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in corn and scallions, and remove from heat. Taste and adjust for seasoning.</li>
	<li>Fit a trimmed tortilla in bottom of springform pan; layer with 1/4 of the beans and 1/2 cup of cheese. Repeat three times, using 1 cup cheese on top layer. Bake until cheese melts, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove side of pan; sprinkle pie with scallions. To serve, slice into wedges.</li></ol>"
