ingredients: |-
  * 1 1/2 cups oat flour 
  * 2 tablespoons flax 
  * 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 
  * 1/2 cup pureed pumpkin 
  * 2 tablespoons water 
  * 2 tablespoons olive oil 
  * 2 strips bacon, fried and broken into roughly 1/4 inch square pieces 
instructions: |-
  * Mix together the flour, flax, and baking powder in a medium-sized bowl until well blended. Set aside. In a large bowl, mix together the pumpkin, water, and olive oil until smooth. 
  * Add the flour mixture and bacon bits and stir until just blended. 
  * Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. 
  * Take about 1 tablespoon of the dough and roll it into a ball in your hands. Press it flat on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper so that it is about 1/2 inch thick. Take your pinky finger and press into the center of the biscuit to create the base of the paw, then use a pen cap to gently indent three circles at the top of the biscuit to make the toes. Repeat this process until you have used all of the dough. 
  * Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 25 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven and allow to cool completely before giving your pup a treat.
