ingredients: "<ul><li>1 1/2 cups oat flour</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons flax</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
	<li>1/2 cup pureed pumpkin</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons water</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
	<li>2 strips bacon, fried and broken into roughly 1/4 inch square pieces</li></ul>"
instructions: "<ol><li>Mix together the flour, flax, and baking powder in a medium-sized bowl until well blended. Set aside. In a large bowl, mix together the pumpkin, water, and olive oil until smooth.</li>
	<li>Add the flour mixture and bacon bits and stir until just blended.</li>
	<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
	<li>Take about 1 tablespoon of the dough and roll it into a ball in your hands. Press it flat on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper so that it is about 1/2 inch thick. Take your pinky finger and press into the center of the biscuit to create the base of the paw, then use a pen cap to gently indent three circles at the top of the biscuit to make the toes. Repeat this process until you have used all of the dough.</li>
	<li>Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 25 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven and allow to cool completely before giving your pup a treat.
	These will keep in an air-tight container in the refrigerator for 2 weeks.</li></ol>"
