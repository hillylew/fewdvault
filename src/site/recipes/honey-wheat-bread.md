ingredients: |-
  * 1/4 cup warm water (115-120 degrees Fahrenheit)
  * 1/4 cup honey
  * 2 packages Red Star Platinum Superior Baking Yeast
  * 3 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
  * 1 tablespoon salt
  * 2 tablespoons melted butter
  * 2 1/4 cups bread flour
instructions: >-
  1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the warm milk, warm water, and honey.
  Sprinkle the yeast over top the liquids and let it sit for 5 minutes until it
  gets foamy.

  2. Add the whole wheat flour and mix it into the liquids using the beater
  blade attachment just until the flour is moistened. Let that mixture sit for
  10 minutes.

  3. Next, add in the salt, butter, and the bread flour. Using the stand mixer
  with the dough hook attachment, beat the dough for 10 minutes. (If you don't
  have a stand mixer you can knead the dough by hand.)

  4. Grease a large bowl and place the dough in the bowl. Cover the dough with a
  cloth and place the bowl in a warm place for the dough to rise. Allow the
  dough to rise until it is double in size.

  5. Shape dough into two loaves and place them in greased 8x4" bread pans.
  Cover the dough and let them rise in a warm place for another 20 minutes or
  until they have a nice rise to them.

  6. Bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes.

  7. For the softest crust, brush the top of the loaves with butter while they
  are still warm.

  8. Allow the bread to cool and slice to serve.

  9. Store any extra bread in an airtight container.
notes: >-
  1. If you don't have honey, the same amount of agave works in a pinch.

  2. One packet of yeast is 2 1/4 teaspoons.

  3. One tablespoon of butter is enough for the post-bake brushing, but it is
  not necessary.
