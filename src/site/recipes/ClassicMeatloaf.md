ingredients: "<ul><li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
	<li>1 cup of minced onion</li>
	<li>1 celery rib, minced</li>
	<li>1 Tbsp minced garlic</li>
	<li>1 carrot, minced</li>
	<li>1/2 cup of minced green onion, including the onion greens</li>
	<li>2 teaspoon salt (use 1 1/2 teaspoons if using Italian sausage)</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
	<li>2/3 cup ketchup, divided 1/3 and 1/3</li>
	<li>1 1/2 pounds of ground beef (chuck)</li>
	<li>3/4 pound of spicy ground pork sausage or Italian sausage (a mix of sweet and hot if you are using links)</li>
	<li>1 cup fresh bread crumbs</li>
	<li>2 large eggs, beaten slightly</li>
	<li>1/3 cup minced fresh parsley leaves</li></ul>"
instructions: "<ol><li>Preheat oven to 350° F, with a rack in the middle.</li>
	<li>In a large, heavy skillet, melt the butter on medium heat until foamy. Add the minced onion, celery, carrot, garlic, and green onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Cover the skillet and cook for an additional 5 minutes, until the carrots are tender, stirring occasionally. Add the salt, freshly ground black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and 1/3 a cup of the ketchup. Cook for 1 more minute. Remove from heat and let cool to the touch.</li>
	<li>In a large bowl, use your clean hands to combine the ground beef, spicy ground pork sausage, eggs, breadcrumbs, the cooked vegetables from step 2, and parsley.</li>
	<li>4 Press mixture into a loaf pan with 2-inch high sides, or form the mixture into a free standing loaf and place in a rimmed roasting pan. Cover the loaf with the remaining ketchup.</li>
	<li>Bake the meatloaf in a 350°F oven for 1 hour, or until the internal temperature of the meatloaf reaches 155°F. Let rest for 10 minutes. Then gently remove by lifting with a spatula to a serving plate, and slice to serve.</li></ol>"
notes: Used canola oil instead of butter, plenty of beer instead of Worcestershire sauce, a bag of boca crumbles instead of meat, and baked at 400 for 40 minutes.
