ingredients: |-
  * 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
  * 1 cup of minced onion 
  * 1 celery rib, minced 
  * 1 Tbsp minced garlic 
  * 1 carrot, minced 
  * 1/2 cup of minced green onion, including the onion greens 
  * 2 teaspoon salt (use 1 1/2 teaspoons if using Italian sausage) 
  * 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
  * 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 
  * 2/3 cup ketchup, divided 1/3 and 1/3 
  * 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef (chuck) 
  * 3/4 pound of spicy ground pork sausage or Italian sausage (a mix of sweet and hot if you are using links) 
  * 1 cup fresh bread crumbs 
  * 2 large eggs, beaten slightly 
  * 1/3 cup minced fresh parsley leaves
instructions: |-
  * Preheat oven to 350° F, with a rack in the middle. 
  * In a large, heavy skillet, melt the butter on medium heat until foamy. Add the minced onion, celery, carrot, garlic, and green onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Cover the skillet and cook for an additional 5 minutes, until the carrots are tender, stirring occasionally. Add the salt, freshly ground black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and 1/3 a cup of the ketchup. Cook for 1 more minute. Remove from heat and let cool to the touch. 
  * In a large bowl, use your clean hands to combine the ground beef, spicy ground pork sausage, eggs, breadcrumbs, the cooked vegetables from step 2, and parsley. 
  * 4 Press mixture into a loaf pan with 2-inch high sides, or form the mixture into a free standing loaf and place in a rimmed roasting pan. Cover the loaf with the remaining ketchup. 
  * Bake the meatloaf in a 350°F oven for 1 hour, or until the internal temperature of the meatloaf reaches 155°F. Let rest for 10 minutes. Then gently remove by lifting with a spatula to a serving plate, and slice to serve.
notes: Used canola oil instead of butter, plenty of beer instead of Worcestershire sauce, a bag of boca crumbles instead of meat, and baked at 400 for 40 minutes.
