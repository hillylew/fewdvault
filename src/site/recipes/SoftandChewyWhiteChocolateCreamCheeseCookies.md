ingredients: "<ul><li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened</li>
	<li>2 ounces cream cheese, softened (use cream cheese in a block)</li>
	<li>3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed</li>
	<li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
	<li>1 large egg</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
	<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>1 3.5-ounce packet instant cheesecake-flavored pudding mix</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
	<li>pinch salt</li>
	<li>10 ounces white chocolate chips</li></ul>"
instructions: "<ol><li>To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large mixing bowl and electric mixer) combine the butter, cream cheese, sugars, egg, vanilla, and beat on medium-high speed until creamed and well combined, about 4 minutes.</li>
	<li>Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the flour, dry pudding mix, baking soda, optional salt, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute.</li>
	<li>Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the white chocolate, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
	<li>Using a large cookie scoop, 1/4-cup measure, or your hands, form approximately 13 to 14 equal-sized mounds of dough, roll into balls, and flatten slightly. Tip – Strategically place a few white chocolate chips right on top of each mound of dough by taking chips from the underside and adding them on top.</li>
	<li>Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading.</li>
	<li>Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat or spray with cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet) and bake for about 11 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center; don’t overbake. Cookies firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for about 10 minutes before serving. I let them cool on the baking sheet and don’t use a rack.</li>
	<li>Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.</li></ol>"
notes: Use cookie scoop instead of 1/4 cup to measure dough to get more than 14 cookies

The cookies are extremely soft, moist, and creamy. I had no willpower against the sweet, creamy white chocolate and the buttery, rich dough. Some of the butter is replaced with cream cheese and the cookies have unparalleled richness. Interestingly, the cream cheese intensifies the buttery flavor so the cookies taste extra buttery, with a mild cheesecake flavor, and zero cakiness. Use old-fashioned brick-style cream cheese. Cream cheese in a tub or that’s ‘spreadable’ isn’t suitable. Lite is okay, but fat-free is not. They’re irresistibly good.
