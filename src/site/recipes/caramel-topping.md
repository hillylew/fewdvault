ingredients: |-
  * 1 cup granulated sugar
  * 6 Tablespoons salted butter, room temperature cut up into 6 pieces
  * 1/2 cup heavy cream, at room temperature
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
instructions: >-
  1. Heat granulated sugar in a medium heavy-duty saucepan over medium heat,
  stirring constantly with a high heat resistant rubber spatula or wooden spoon.
  Sugar will form clumps and eventually melt into a thick brown, amber-colored
  liquid as you continue to stir. Be careful not to burn.

  2. Once sugar is completely melted, immediately stir in the butter until melted and combined. Be careful in this step because the caramel will bubble rapidly when the butter is added. If you notice the butter separating or if the sugar clumps up, remove from heat and vigorously whisk to combine it again. (If you’re nervous for splatter, wear kitchen gloves. Keep whisking until it comes back together, even if it takes 3-4 minutes. It will eventually– just keep whisking. Return to heat when it’s combined again.)

  3. After the butter has melted and combined with the caramelized sugar, cook for 1 minute without stirring.

  4. Very slowly stir in 1/2 cup of heavy cream. Since the heavy cream is colder than the hot caramel, the mixture will rapidly bubble when added. 

  5. After all the heavy cream has been added, stop stirring and allow to boil for 1 minute. It will rise in the pan as it boils.

  6. Remove from heat and stir in the salt. Allow to slightly cool down before using. Caramel thickens as it cools.

  7. Cover tightly and store for up to 1 month in the refrigerator. Caramel solidifies in the refrigerator. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove to desired consistency.
notes: >-
  1. **Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions:** You can make this caramel in
  advance. Make sure it is covered tightly and store it for up to 1 month in the
  refrigerator. Warm the caramel up for a few seconds before using in a recipe.
  This caramel is OK at room temperature for a day if you’re traveling or
  gifting it. You can freeze the salted caramel, too. Freeze in an airtight
  container for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature,
  then warm up before using.

  2. **Butter:** Unsalted butter may be used instead, though I prefer salted. No other changes need to be made to the recipe if using unsalted.

  3. **Heavy Cream:** Heavy cream (approximately 36% milk fat) may also be sold as whipping cream. Light whipping cream (30% milk fat), or double cream (48% milk fat) may be substituted. Do not use milk. Room temperature cream is best.

  4. **Salted Caramel:** if you want salted caramel, increase salt to 1 0 1,5 tsp. Use regular table salt or kosher salt. If using larger flaky salt, add 1 teaspoon, taste, then add more if desired. This recipe works with any variety of salt. You can always add 3/4 teaspoon, taste, then add more if desired.

  5. **Caramel Candies:** This caramel is great as a sauce, topping, or filling, but won’t set up properly to make soft caramel candies. Here is my soft caramels recipe.

Made from only 4 simple ingredients in only 10 minutes, this homemade caramel is salty, sweet, and irresistibly buttery. No candy thermometer required and the possibilities for serving are endless. (Though just a spoon is acceptable!) Use caution as the cooking caramel may splatter. Stand back and wear kitchen gloves if desired. Review recipe notes prior to beginning.
