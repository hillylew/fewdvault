ingredients: |-
  * 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 
  * 2 cups white sugar 
  * 1/2 cup vegetable oil 
  * 4 eggs 
  * 2 tsp vanilla extract 
  * 2 cups all purpose flour 
  * 2 tsp baking powder 
  * 1 tsp salt 
  * ~1/2 cup confectioner's sugar (for coating) 
instructions: |- 
  1. In a medium bowl, mix together cocoa powder, sugar and oil. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Mix until smooth and shiny. 
  2. In another bowl, combine together flour, baking powder and salt. Stir into the cocoa mixture with a wooden spoon just until smooth. 
  3. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (I chilled them overnight). 
  4. Preheat oven to 180C / 350F. Prepare 4 cookie sheets with parchment paper. Roll dough into 1 inch (I rolled them into 2 inch balls.Recommended!) balls. Coat each ball in icing sugar and place onto cookie sheets. Leave some space because they will spread. 
  5. Bake for 10-12 minutes for smaller cookies, and 12-14 minutes for larger cookies. Let cool for at least 5 minutes before removing from cookie sheets. 
notes: Use cookie scoop to measure dough
