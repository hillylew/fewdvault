ingredients: "<ul>
  <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
	<li>2 cups white sugar</li>
	<li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
	<li>4 eggs</li>
	<li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
	<li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
	<li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
	<li>1 tsp salt</li>
	<li>~1/2 cup confectioner's sugar (for coating)</li>
  </ul>"
instructions: "<ol>
	<li>In a medium bowl, mix together cocoa powder, sugar and oil. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Mix until smooth and shiny.</li>
	<li>In another bowl, combine together flour, baking powder and salt. Stir into the cocoa mixture with a wooden spoon just until smooth.</li>
	<li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (I chilled them overnight).</li>
	<li>Preheat oven to 180C / 350F. Prepare 4 cookie sheets with parchment paper. Roll dough into 1 inch (I rolled them into 2 inch balls.Recommended!) balls. Coat each ball in icing sugar and place onto cookie sheets. Leave some space because they will spread.</li>
	<li>Bake for 10-12 minutes for smaller cookies, and 12-14 minutes for larger cookies. Let cool for at least 5 minutes before removing from cookie sheets.</li>
  </ol>"
notes: Use cookie scoop to measure dough
