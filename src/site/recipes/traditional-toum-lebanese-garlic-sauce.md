ingredients: |-
  * 1 cup cloves garlic (4 1/2 ounces; 130g)
  * 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt (for table salt, use 1 teaspoon)
  * 1/4 cup (60g) fresh juice from about 2 lemons, divided

instructions: >-


  1. Using a paring knife, split each garlic clove in half lengthwise. With the
  tip of the knife, [remove the germ from each garlic clove
  half](https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/08/what-is-a-garlic-germ-and-should-you-remove-it.html).

  2. **Food Processor Method:** Place the de-germed garlic and kosher salt in
  the bowl of a food processor. Pulse garlic in short bursts, occasionally
  removing the lid to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a flexible rubber
  spatula, until finely minced. Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and continue
  processing until a paste begins to form. Add another tablespoon lemon juice
  and process until completely smooth and slightly fluffy.

  3. With the food processor running, slowly drizzle in 1/2 cup oil in a very
  thin stream, followed by 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Repeat with another 1/2 cup
  oil and remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Continue the process, alternating
  1/2 cup oil and 1 tablespoon water, until all the oil and water have been
  incorporated. Transfer toum to a container and store in the fridge for up to 1
  month.

  4. **Mortar and Pestle Method:** Depending on the size of your mortar, you may
  need to make the recipe in smaller batches, halving or quartering the
  ingredient amounts. In the mortar, combine garlic and salt and grind until it
  becomes a smooth paste. Work oil into paste 1 teaspoon at a time. After adding
  1 tablespoon oil, work in a few drops of lemon juice. Repeat until all the
  oil, lemon juice, and water have been incorporated.
