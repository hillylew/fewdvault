instructions: "<ol><li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees.</li>
	Grease a 6-doughnut pan well with baking spray.</li></ol>
	<strong>doughnuts</strong><ol>
	<li>Combine dry ingredients in a large bowl and whisk together. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add in milk, egg, butter, and maple syrup. Stir until well combined.</li>
	<li>Stir in strawberry mixture, starting with 1/2 of it and adding more only if needed. Batter should be wet, but not runny.</li>
	<li>Put dough into a pastry bag or plastic bag and snip approx 1-inch off end. Pipe batter into each well, reserving extra batter.</li>
	<li>Bake for 7-9 minutes until doughnuts spring back when touched. Let cool five minutes and turn onto a cooling rack to cool completely. Spray pan again and continue with the rest of batter until all doughnuts have been made. While doughnuts are cooling make glaze.</li></ol>
	<strong>Glaz</strong><ol>
	<li>Stir all ingredients together until smooth. When doughnuts are cooled dip each into glaze (twice if you want to be naughty about it) and place back on cooling rack to let glaze set.</li>
	<li>When glaze has set enjoy!</li></ol>"
