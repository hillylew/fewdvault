ingredients: |-
  * 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided 
  * 1 16-ounce package shelf-stable gnocchi, (see Tip) 
  * 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced 
  * 4 cloves garlic, minced 
  * 1/2 cup water 
  * 6 cups chopped chard leaves, (about 1 small bunch) or spinach 
  * 1 15-ounce can diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings 
  * 1 15-ounce can white beans, rinsed 
  * 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 
  * 1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese 
  * 1/4 cup finely shredded Parmesan cheese 
instructions: |-
  * Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add gnocchi and cook, stirring often, until plumped and starting to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. 
  * Add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil and onion to the pan and cook, stirring, over medium heat, for 2 minutes. Stir in garlic and water. Cover and cook until the onion is soft, 4 to 6 minutes. Add chard (or spinach) and cook, stirring, until starting to wilt, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, beans and pepper and bring to a simmer. Stir in the gnocchi and sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan. Cover and cook until the cheese is melted and the sauce is bubbling, about 3 minutes.
