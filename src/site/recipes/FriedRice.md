ingredients: |-
  * 3 cups cooked white rice (day old or leftover rice works best!) 
  * 3 tbs sesame oil 
  * 1 cup frozen peas and carrots (thawed) 
  * 1 small onion, chopped 
  * 2 tsp minced garlic 
  * 2 eggs, slightly beaten 
  * 1/4 cup soy sauce 
instructions: |-
  * On medium high heat, heat the oil in a large skillet or wok. Add the peas/carrots mix, onion and garlic. Stir fry until tender. 
  * Lower the heat to medium low and push the mixture off to one side, then pour your eggs on the other side of skillet and stir fry until scrambled. Now add the rice and soy sauce and blend all together well. 
  * Stir fry until thoroughly heated!  **You could really play around with this rice too! Try adding some diced ham, or green onion :) Yum! 
notes: Don't do the soy sauce! Find something else.
