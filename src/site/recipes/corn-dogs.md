ingredients: |-
  * 1 cup yellow cornmeal
  * 1 cup all-purpose flour
  * 1/4 tsp salt
  * 1/8 tsp black pepper
  * 4 tsp baking powder
  * 1 egg
  * 1 cup milk
  * 1 quart vegetable oil for frying
  * 2 (16 ounce) packages beef frankfurters
  * 16 wooden skewers
instructions: >-
  1. In a medium bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, salt, pepper, sugar and baking
  powder. Stir in eggs and milk.

  2. Preheat oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Insert wooden skewers into frankfurters. Roll frankfurters in batter until well coated.

  3. Fry 2 or 3 corn dogs at a time until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
notes: >-
  

  Works well to briskly spin the skewer while dripping the coating along the length. Doesn't need to be perfect because it puffs up very well during the frying.
