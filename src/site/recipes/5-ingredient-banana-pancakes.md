title: 5 Ingredient Banana Pancakes
ingredients: |-
  * 2 medium ripe bananas 
  * 2 tsp baking powder 
  * 1 tsp vanilla extract 
  * 2 large eggs 
  * 4 to 6 Tbsp AP flour 
  * 1/2 tsp coconut oil for the pan 
instructions: |-
  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Allow pancakes to keep cooking in the oven for 6-7 minutes. 
  2. In a large mixing bowl, add bananas and mash until only small bits remain. Then add baking powder and vanilla extract and use a fork or whisk to mash until thoroughly combined. 
  3. Next add eggs, break yolks with a fork or whisk, and whisk thoroughly until well combined. 
  4. Lastly, add flour 1 Tbsp (9 g) at a time until a thick but scoopable batter is achieved (thicker than your average pancake batter, but not so thick that it appears dry). If you add too much flour, add a little milk to thin. 
  5. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add a little cooking oil to coat the pan. Then spoon in roughly 3-Tbsp amounts of batter and reduce heat to low. These benefit from cooking slower and lower than your average pancakes. Cover with a lid to help the center cook through. 
  6. Cook for 3-4 minutes, then remove lid and flip carefully. Cook for 3-4 minutes more (lowering heat as needed if cooking too fast) or until the underside is golden brown. Transfer cooked pancakes to the preheated oven on the prepared baking sheet. Continue cooking until all batter is used up â€” as recipe is written, ~6 pancakes. 
  7. Best when fresh, though leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator 3-4 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. To reheat, microwaving is most effective. Otherwise, toast or bake in a 350 degree F (176 C) oven until hot.
