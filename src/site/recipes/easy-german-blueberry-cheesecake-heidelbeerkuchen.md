instructions: >-
  1. Preheat oven to 350 F

  2. Grease a 9” Springform Pan (If you don’t have a Springform pan, it’s going
  to be tricky to get the cake out)

  3. Rinse the blueberries, and let them sit in the colander or on a towel to
  dry

  4. Put the Neufchatel cheese, milk, egg, oil, sugar, vanilla sugar, salt into
  the mixer and beat until smooth.

  5. Add flour and baking powder. Mix until the dough comes together. The dough
  will be sort of stiff.

  The dough will be sort of stiff.

  6. Press it into the bottom of the pan, and up the sides about 1 ½ to 2
  inches. It’s not going to be very thick. Just do your best. Patch any holes
  and even off the top edge.

  7. Fill the unbaked crust with blueberries.

  8. In a mixer with a whisk, whip the Butter, Sugar, Neufchatel cheese, egg,
  vanilla sugar, cornstarch and milk until SMOOTH. (The filling is sweet, don't
  worry, the berries balance it out.)

  9. Pour the filling over the blueberries… even it out over the top it mostly
  covers them (a few peaking through is ok.) You don’t want it over the edge of
  the dough though.

  10. Bake 60 minutes and check. Does it look mostly done? A few brown spots are
  ok… it shouldn’t be too wobbly, but it's better to go too long than too short
  (I went 62 minutes, and could have used another minute or two). Don’t go
  longer than 70 minutes.
