  * 1/2 cup shredded carrots 
  * 10 ounces frozen spinach, thawed and drained 
  * 6 Quorn naked chik'n cutlets 
  * 6 ounces light cream cheese 
  * 1/2 cup Sargento 4 cheese Italian reduced fat shreds 
  * 2 tbsp vegenaise reduced fat (or light mayo) 
  * black pepper to taste 
  * garlic powder to taste

  * 1/2 cup panko or breadcrumbs (optional) 
instructions: |-
  * Preheat oven to 350°F. 
  * Soften cream cheese and mayo, stir in veggies. 
  * Heat up chik'n, cube, and mix into filling. Mix in shredded cheese and seasonings. Mix well. 
  * Liberally spray baking sheet(s) with olive oil. 
  * Set up a station for egg roll wrappers. A clean plate and bowl of water should suffice. 
  * Place 1/3 cup chicken mixture into the middle of each wrapper. 
  * Fold up one corner of the egg roll wrapper at a time, wetting the top after each fold so it holds together. They will be more like squares than balls. 
  * Liberally spray each ball with olive oil so they crisp up. 
  * Sprinkle each with breadcrumbs, then do a quick once over with olive oil spray. 
  * Bake at 350°F approximately 20 minutes or until browned. 
notes: Don't skimp on garlic powder or olive oil spray.
