ingredients: |-
  * 1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
  * 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
  * 1 teaspoon baking soda
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * 3 large eggs, separated
  * 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
  * 1/3 cup granulated sugar
  * 1 and 3/4 cups buttermilk*
  * 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
instructions: >-
  1. Preheat waffle maker on medium-high heat. Preheat oven to 200F degrees.
  Place a wire rack on a baking sheet; set aside.

  2. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. 

  3. In another large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, butter, sugar, buttermilk, and vanilla together until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk gently until smooth. Do not overmix.

  4. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. I typically use a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment to whisk the egg whites. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the batter.

  5. Pour 1/3 cup of the batter into each well of the waffle maker (or less if your waffle maker is smaller) and close the lid. Cook the waffles until golden brown and crisp, 5-6 minutes. Transfer the cooked waffles to the wire rack and keep warm in the preheated oven as you cook the rest. Repeat to cook the remaining batter.

  6. Serve the waffles immediately with butter and maple syrup, or your choice of toppings.
notes: "**Buttermilk:** Though I typically suggest a DIY buttermilk option using
  regular milk and vinegar/lemon, I highly recommend real buttermilk. I used low
  fat buttermilk, but full fat works too. I do not suggest any substitutions."

Homemade buttermilk waffles are delightfully crisp on the outside and light as air inside. This is my favorite recipe for fluffy homemade waffles with hints of butter and vanilla in each bite!
