ingredients: |-
  * 4 ounces cream cheese, softened to room temperature
  * ½ cup powdered sugar
  * ¼ cup unsweetened coconut cream, see tips
  * ½ teaspoon coconut extract
  * 4 cups sweetened shredded coconut, divided in half
  * 1 cup finely ground almond flour
  * 10 ounces vanilla almond bark
instructions: >-
  1. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.

  2. In a large mixing bowl, beat together, using a handheld mixer on medium speed, the softened cream cheese, powdered sugar, unsweetened coconut cream, and coconut extract for 2 minutes or until smooth and thickened.

  3. To the cream cheese mixture, add 2 cups of the sweetened shredded coconut and the finely ground almond flour until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined.

  4. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

  5. Using a 1½-inch cookie scoop, scoop out the coconut snowball mixture and form it into a ball. Place the ball onto the parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Repeat until all the coconut snowballs have been formed.

  6. Place the coconut snowballs back into the refrigerator to stay cold while you prepare the vanilla almond bark and coconut coating.

  7. Place the vanilla almond bark into a microwave-safe bowl and heat for 1 minute. Stir and repeat in 30-second increments until your almond bark is melted and smooth. You are best to follow the directions on the packaging for melting according to the brand of almond bark you are using.

  8. Add the remaining 2 cups of sweetened shredded coconut to a separate bowl.

  9. Remove the coconut snowballs from the refrigerator. Using a fork, dip one coconut snowball into the melted vanilla almond bark, be sure to tap the fork onto the side of the bowl to remove any excess, then drop it into the bowl of the sweetened shredded coconut to coat the entire coconut snowball.

  10. Place the coated coconut snowball back onto the parchment-lined baking sheet to allow the vanilla almond bark to harden and set. Repeat until all the coconut snowballs have been coated.

  11. Place your coconut snowballs back into the refrigerator for another 30 minutes to firm up completely before serving or storing them.
notes: A﻿ very nice gluten-free Chrismas cookie option. Not nut-free
